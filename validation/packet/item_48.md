# Item 48

**Area:** Falkner–Skan at β = −1988/10000, reversed-flow branch

**Source:** see the claim

## Claim generated from the Lean statement (machine-produced; this is what was proved)

**It holds that**

- there is `f : ℝ → ℝ` such that there is `p : ℝ → ℝ` such that there is `q : ℝ → ℝ` such that (for every `η : ℝ`, if `η ∈ Set.Ici 0`, then `HasDerivWithinAt f (p η) (Set.Ici 0) η`) and (for every `η : ℝ`, if `η ∈ Set.Ici 0`, then `HasDerivWithinAt p (q η) (Set.Ici 0) η`) and (for every `η : ℝ`, if `η ∈ Set.Ici 0`, then `HasDerivWithinAt q (-(f η * q η) - -1988 / 10000 * (1 - p η ^ 2)) (Set.Ici 0) η`) and (`f 0 = 0`) and (`p 0 = 0`) and (`Filter.Tendsto p Filter.atTop (nhds 1)`) and (for every `η : ℝ`, if `η ∈ Set.Ici 0`, then (`-1 ≤ p η`) and (`p η ≤ 1`)) and (for every `M : ℝ`, `∀ᶠ (η : ℝ) in Filter.atTop, M * (1 - p η) ≤ q η`) and (`-515743e-8 < q 0`) and (`q 0 < -515741e-8`)

## Author's paraphrase (hand-written; checked only by prose rules)

Falkner–Skan with β = −1988/10000: there is a solution (f, p, q) of f''' + f f'' + β(1 − f'²) = 0 on [0, ∞) with
f(0) = 0, p(0) = 0, p → 1, −1 ≤ p ≤ 1 on [0, ∞) and, for every M, `∀ᶠ (η : ℝ) in Filter.atTop, M * (1 - p η) ≤ q η`, with
−0.00515743 < q(0) < −0.00515741.

## Definitions it uses

Only Mathlib notions.

## What the system checked mechanically

- Proof checked by the Lean kernel in CI (Lean 4 + Mathlib), standard axioms only.
- Definitions pinned by a machine-checked specification: —.
- Printed formulas used (transcriptions; ² = machine-checked agreement with a blind second reading): —.
- Non-vacuity (all hypotheses satisfiable at once, machine-checked witness): unconditional.
- Parameters the statement fixes to numbers (generated from the statement; the claim is proved for these values only): —.
