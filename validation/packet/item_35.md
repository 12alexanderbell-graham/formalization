**Area:** F2

**Source:** Capozziello, Lazkoz, Salzano, PRD 84, 124061 (2011), arXiv:1104.3096 (v1 and v2), Eq. (22): flat matter + CPL l₀, w_a² term missing a factor 9

## Claim generated from the Lean statement (machine-produced; this is what was proved)

**For every** `Ω : ℝ`, `w₀ : ℝ`, `wₐ : ℝ`:

**then**

- there is `a : ℝ → ℝ` such that (the scale factor `a` obeys the flat matter plus CPL dark energy Friedmann expansion law with the present matter density parameter `Ω`, the present dark energy equation of state `w₀`, the equation of state evolution parameter `wₐ` and the observation time `t₀ := 0` (spatially flat universe with dust and separately conserved dark energy; redshift z is measured from `t₀ := 0`; `Ω` is the present matter density parameter; holds on a whole neighbourhood of `t₀ := 0`; present Hubble rate is positive so the universe is expanding)) and (`ContDiffAt ℝ 5 a 0`)

Program definitions in this claim:

- `IsFlatCPL Ω w₀ wₐ a t₀` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `flatCPL_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the scale factor `a` obeys the flat matter plus CPL dark energy Friedmann expansion law with the present matter density parameter `Ω`, the present dark energy equation of state `w₀`, the equation of state evolution parameter `wₐ` and the observation time `t₀` (spatially flat universe with dust and separately conserved dark energy; redshift z is measured from `t₀`; `Ω` is the present matter density parameter; holds on a whole neighbourhood of `t₀`; present Hubble rate is positive so the universe is expanding); by definition, means (`0 < hubble a t₀`) and (`∀ᶠ (t : ℝ) in nhds t₀, 0 < a t ∧ DifferentiableAt ℝ a t ∧ hubble a t = hubble a t₀ * √(Ω * (1 + redshift a t₀ t) ^ 3 + (1 - Ω) * (1 + redshift a t₀ t) ^ (3 * (1 + w₀ + wₐ)) * Real.exp (-(3 * wₐ * redshift a t₀ t) / (1 + redshift a t₀ t)))`). Phrase lines proved in Lean (statements in PHRASE_LINES.md): «present Hubble rate is positive so the universe is expanding» only assuming the scale factor `a` obeys the flat matter plus CPL dark energy Friedmann expansion law with the present matter density parameter `Ω`, the present dark energy equation of state `w₀`, the equation of state evolution parameter `wₐ` and the observation time `t₀` (spatially flat universe with dust and separately conserved dark energy; redshift z is measured from `t₀`; `Ω` is the present matter density parameter; holds on a whole neighbourhood of `t₀`; present Hubble rate is positive so the universe is expanding)

## Author's paraphrase (hand-written; checked only by prose rules)

**Flat matter + CPL models exist for every Ω, w₀, wₐ** (at `t₀ = 0`, `C⁵` there).

## Formal statement (Lean 4)

```lean
theorem exists_flatCPL (Ω w₀ wₐ : ℝ) :
    ∃ a : ℝ → ℝ, IsFlatCPL Ω w₀ wₐ a 0 ∧ ContDiffAt ℝ 5 a 0 := …
```

## What the system checked mechanically

- Proof checked by the Lean kernel in CI (Lean 4 + Mathlib), standard axioms only.
- Definitions pinned by a machine-checked specification: IsFlatCPL.
- Printed formulas used (transcriptions; ² = machine-checked agreement with a blind second reading): —.
- Non-vacuity (all hypotheses satisfiable at once, machine-checked witness): unconditional.
- Parameters the statement fixes to numbers (generated from the statement; the claim is proved for these values only): IsFlatCPL: t₀ = 0.
