**Area:** F4

**Source:** Bamba, Capozziello, Nojiri, Odintsov, Astrophys. Space Sci. 342, 155 (2012), arXiv:1205.3421 (v1, v2, v3), Eq. (10.54): y-redshift luminosity-distance coefficient D²_{L,y} has the wrong overall sign

## Claim generated from the Lean statement (machine-produced; this is what was proved)

**For every** `a : ℝ → ℝ`, `t₀ : ℝ`:

**assuming**

1. `ContDiffAt ℝ 3 a t₀`
2. `a t₀ ≠ 0`
3. `hubble a t₀ ≠ 0`

**then**

- `(fun t => remainderY correctD2y a t₀ t) =o[nhds t₀] fun t => yred a t₀ t ^ 3`

Program definitions in this claim:

- `D1y q` — PRINTED, not pinned; an independent blind second reading of the source agrees with this transcription (`Checked.Trust.Transcriptions.agree_D1y`); its name is not checked (for `q : ℝ`): is defined as `-(1 / 2) * (-3 + q)`
- `correctD2y q j Ω` — FORMULA, not pinned; name and body agree with a blind second formulation (`Checked.Trust.Formulations.agree_correctD2y`) (for `q : ℝ`, `j : ℝ`, `Ω : ℝ`): is defined as `1 / 6 * (12 - 5 * q + 3 * q ^ 2 - j - Ω)`
- `cosmoCoeff n a t` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `cosmoCoeffCore_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the cosmographic coefficient with the derivative order of the coefficient `n`, the scale factor `a` and the time of evaluation `t` (`n`-th time derivative of the scale factor over the scale factor divided by the `n`-th power of the Hubble rate; orders 0 and 1 coefficients are one; The order 2 coefficient is minus the deceleration parameter usually written q; The order 3 coefficient is the jerk parameter usually written j; The order 4 coefficient is the snap parameter usually written s; The order 5 coefficient is the lerk parameter usually written l); by definition, `cosmoCoeff n a t` is `iteratedDeriv n a t / (a t * hubble a t ^ n)`
- `decel a t` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `decelSpec_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the deceleration parameter with the scale factor `a` and the cosmic time of evaluation `t` (minus acceleration times scale factor over velocity squared; minus the second time derivative times the scale factor divided by the squared first time derivative; negative value means accelerating expansion); by definition, `decel a t` is `-(deriv (deriv a) t * a t) / deriv a t ^ 2`
- `hubble a t` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `hubbleSpec_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the Hubble rate with the scale factor `a` and the cosmic time of evaluation `t` (logarithmic derivative of the scale factor with respect to cosmic time; positive for expansion and negative for contraction); by definition, `hubble a t` is `deriv a t / a t`
- `lumDistFlat a t₀ t` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `lumDistFlat_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the luminosity distance in flat FLRW with the scale factor `a`, the observation time `t₀` and the emission time `t` (units in which the speed of light is one); by definition, `lumDistFlat a t₀ t` is `a t₀ * (1 + redshift a t₀ t) * comoving a t₀ t`
- `remainderY D2 a t₀ t` — COMPOSITE, not pinned, so only the formula shown is checked, not its name (for `D2 : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ`, `a : ℝ → ℝ`, `t₀ : ℝ`, `t : ℝ`): is defined as `hubble a t₀ * lumDistFlat a t₀ t - seriesY (D2 (decel a t₀) (cosmoCoeff 3 a t₀) 1) (decel a t₀) (yred a t₀ t)`
- `seriesY d2 q y` — FORMULA, not pinned; name and body agree with a blind second formulation (`Checked.Trust.Formulations.agree_seriesY`) (for `d2 : ℝ`, `q : ℝ`, `y : ℝ`): is defined as `y * (1 + D1y q * y + d2 * y ^ 2)`
- `yred a t₀ t` — **PINNED** (pin theorem `yRedSpec_pins`): phrase (hand-written, linted): the y redshift with the scale factor `a`, the observation time `t₀` and the emission time `t` (positive for redshift, negative for blueshift; one minus the scale factor at emission over that at observation; always below one for a positive scale factor); by definition, `yred a t₀ t` is `redshift a t₀ t / (1 + redshift a t₀ t)`

## Author's paraphrase (hand-written; checked only by prose rules)

**Luminosity distance to third order in `y`** (FLRW of any spatial curvature `K`, correct `D²_{L,y}`): for every
scale factor that is `C³` at `t₀`, with `a(t₀) ≠ 0` and `H₀ ≠ 0`.

## Formal statement (Lean 4)

```lean
theorem lumDist_y_third_order (a : ℝ → ℝ) (t₀ : ℝ) (ha : ContDiffAt ℝ 3 a t₀)
    (ha0 : a t₀ ≠ 0) (hH : hubble a t₀ ≠ 0) :
    (fun t => remainderY correctD2y a t₀ t) =o[𝓝 t₀] (fun t => yred a t₀ t ^ 3) := …
```

## What the system checked mechanically

- Proof checked by the Lean kernel in CI (Lean 4 + Mathlib), standard axioms only.
- Definitions pinned by a machine-checked specification: cosmoCoeff, lumDistFlat, yred, decel, hubble.
- Printed formulas used (transcriptions; ² = machine-checked agreement with a blind second reading): D1y².
- Non-vacuity (all hypotheses satisfiable at once, machine-checked witness): `lumDist_y_third_order`.
- Parameters the statement fixes to numbers (generated from the statement; the claim is proved for these values only): cosmoCoeff: n = 3.
