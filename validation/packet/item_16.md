# Item 16

**Area:** F1

**Source:** Aviles, Gruber, Luongo, Quevedo, PRD 86, 123516 (2012), arXiv:1204.2007 (v1 and v2), Eq. (15): misprinted ΛCDM l₀ and m₀

## Claim in plain words (the system's own text)

**Refutation of the printed m₀ in Eq. (15).** On Einstein–de Sitter the printed formula
gives `−134`, the true value is `−455/4`.

## Formal statement (Lean 4)

```lean
theorem avilesM0Claim_false : ¬ AvilesM0Claim := …
```

## Definitions it uses

See GLOSSARY.md: `Cosmography.Aviles.IsFlatLCDM`, `Cosmography.Aviles.cosmoCoeff`, `Cosmography.Aviles.AvilesM0Claim`, `Cosmography.hubble`, `Cosmography.redshift`

## What the system checked mechanically

- Proof checked by the Lean kernel in CI (Lean 4 + Mathlib), standard axioms only.
- Definitions pinned by a machine-checked specification: IsFlatLCDM, cosmoCoeff.
- Printed formulas used (transcriptions; ² = machine-checked agreement with a blind second reading): AvilesM0Claim.
- Non-vacuity (all hypotheses satisfiable at once, machine-checked witness): unconditional.
- Source file: `Checked/Cosmography/LCDMCoefficients.lean` (do not open it before submitting your answers).
